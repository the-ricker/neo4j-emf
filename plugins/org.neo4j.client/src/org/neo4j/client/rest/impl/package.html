<h1>Why have data objects?</h1>
<p>RestNodeImpl and RestRelationshipImlp have child objects NodeData and RelationshipData. Why is that? 
Why not just marshal and un-marshal JSON to the node and relationship objects?</p>
<p>Two reasons. First, the set of API attributes and the set of JSON properties are not the same. There 
are many attributes in the API that are not in the JSON, and vice versa. Having the NodeData and RelationshipData 
classes make what is JSON and what is not very clear and clean. 
<p>Second, the implementation is designed for 
stub objects. The existence of a RestNode object and the loading of the RestNode object are two different steps. </p>
