<h3>IDs</h3>
EMF classes have an ID attribute. It should probably be mapped to a Neo4j index. 

<h3>Resources</h3>
What defines a resource? Is it an entire database? Or is the database a resource set? 
Perhaps a resource is an arbitrary node in the database. Containment is after all just 
another relationship.
